# diaryextension

**This README is still incomplete!**

IMPORTANT: Make sure to include these two questions in your form:
- DIARY-USERNAME: Will be used to automatically collect the participant's user name
- DIARY-URL: Will collect the URL that was being visited when the participant decided to add a diary entry
_("DIARY-USERNAME" and "DIARY-URL" should be the question text.)_


A prompt to complete a diary entry will be triggered `secondsBeforePrompt` seconds after starting the session.
In their first session, prticipants will be asked to enter a username to identify them through the study.

## Future work:
Implementing other trigger rules like:
- Daily: after visiting N pages in domain
- Per page: aftern N visits to the page

- Domain-wide
- Specific pages in domain
